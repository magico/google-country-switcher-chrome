# google-country-switcher

This extension is based on Redfly’s SEO Global extension for Chrome, which has been discontinued it’s not available anymore. It allows to easily change Google to any country you want in just one click.

Luckly I managed to save a copy and I made some improvements to it. For instance, when you install it for the first time you’ll have all the AOS countries installed (rather than having to add them manually).

How to install:
1) Unzip the attachment somewhere in your computer where it can stay there.

2) In Google Chrome go to Window > Extensions > Load Unpacked Extension… and just go to the folder when you unzipped the attachment.

3) That’s it. In your URL toolbar you should have a new icon and when you click on it you will get a list of countries. 

4) Test it out. Go to https://www.google.com/search?q=apple and then select a different country. The results should appear in the native language of the country.
